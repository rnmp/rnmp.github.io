In this talk, video game programmer Jonathan Blow speaks of the sometimes
unnecessary complexity that comes with writing software. Systems that would
initially be well understood (e.g. a single person can read and change them) are
now split in different services and abstractions that are harder to inherit and
could eventually lose meaning (the collapse of civilization).

Iâ€™m a bit more optimistic, but he does give a worrisome example (paraphrasing):

As video game engines such as Unity continue to gain popularity and custom
engines become a rarity, will there be anyone who knows how to write them 50
years from now? Will anyone still be around to understand Unity itself?
