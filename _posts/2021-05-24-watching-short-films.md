Not a crazy update. Just I noticed the often underappreciated quality of short films. Will be watching new shorts this week. Some places I'll be checking out:

* [Vimeo, of course](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/browse/short_films)
* [Short of the Week](https://www.shortoftheweek.com/)
* [ILoveShortFilms.com](https://iloveshortfilms.com/)
