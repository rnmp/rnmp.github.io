I love looking at faces. In the subway, in movies, etc. And if you spend enough
time with me, you’ll hear me make weird comparisons like "this person looks
like this other person".

I wanna say that I get my look-alike observations pretty close, but I've always
wanted to actually take the time to visually corroborate. Seeing this
dopplegänger photography project definitely scratches that itch.

I do wish this was a coffee table book, though.
