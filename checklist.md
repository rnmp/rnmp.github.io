# Work of Effort

1. Pay attention to the words. Read carefully and listen carefully when spoken to (even if indirectly). 
2. Likewise, write or speak carefully by thinking through your answer or your initial idea: Who are you talking to? What is the context? How much do they need to know? Why do they care?
3. Work calmly. SLOWLY.
