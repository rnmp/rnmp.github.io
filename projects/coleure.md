Coleure was a color picker that focused on a few aspects that I didn't see in other
tools at the time.

# Curated colors

You didnâ€™t start from scratch. I drew inspiration from a PANTONE sampler and included
hundreds of colors to start from, so it felt like exploring a store of time-tested colors.

# Color mixing

You could play with colors. There was a mix tool that allowed you to choose a color in
between other colors and get new results (as if it was paint).

# The schemer

You could literally play with colors. I included a HTML/CSS previewer in which you could use
colors in your different palettes and cycle through them to find one that worked for your
project.

# Helpful insights

Coleure would also tell you if the color you had had enough contrast against
black, white, or another color. Most color pickers now have this functionality.
