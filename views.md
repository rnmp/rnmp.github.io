title: My Views on Design — Rolando Murillo

I’m writing the following to document the concepts and "views" on design that stood out to me in the past few years and I think are worth sharing. While I'm personally unable to sit down and say "This is my design process—", these principles guide me through the products I create.

They are not in order and may even contradict each other, since they're all—as you'll see—conditional and depend 100% on the problem that you're meant to solve through design.

# The modern designer
As simplistic as it may sound, I cannot find a better definition of what I believe design is other than [the one that Wikipedia provides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design):

>Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object or a system (as in architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams and sewing patterns).

This elaboration very much aligns with the concept of product design: product designers oversee aspects that go beyond the visual interface of a digital product. While some designers group these additional layers into "user experience", I find this redundant. A modern digital product designer (or simply just _product designer_, or _designer_ depending on the context) should implicitly be good and care about the interface _and_ experience of their creation.

# Everything that your product conveys is design
What is more: the API of the code behind your digital product is design. The content strategy to create traction for it is design. The way the customer service behaves is design. The pricing is design. EVERYTHING is design. Even if you're not personally responsible for some of these aspects of what you're building with your team, the _direction_ that you give and your contributions to them should be part of your process. 

The more time you dedicate in learning and understanding these different spectrums (even if they're not your area of expertise) the more equipped you will be to communicate your creative approaches with different teams. In the end, the result will be more consistent, your voice will be more present throughout the experience of your customers. The level attention that you give to different aspects is up to you and depend entirely on the product.

# Enough is more

# Early designs behave as research tools

# Gut feelings: design is an art too

# Data is tool, not a dogma
