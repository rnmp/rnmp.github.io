# Are you a fan of well-made digital products?

I'm Rolando, a Product Designer who knows Technology. I get excited when I realize someone has thought deeply about my very specific needs as a user and customer. It fascinates me.

## I meet businesses where they're at

I work with companies to understand who they're serving, what's their audience like and what needs to be accomplished.

## I design user friendly interfaces

I have a background in graphic arts and interaction design with focus in usability.

## I prototype solutions effectively

I identify when and how to best validate solutions before they enter production.

## I am also a Developer

I know how platforms are built and how technological breakthroughs occur. I work with tech teams when needed to facilitate collaboration with other teams.
