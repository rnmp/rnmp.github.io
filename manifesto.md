# Manifesto

I place myself in a very unique position. I've been involved in two different but very symiotic industries: tech & design.
      As a creative, my purpose is to bring new ideas and concepts in the world.
      As a technologist, my intention is to solve society's difficulties.
      As an entrepreneur, my intention is to beat time & adversities.
      My goal is to become someone who can bring ideas to the world that are so powerful and world-changing that they deserve their own name.
      Companies need to be able to test & validate ideas as often as possible in order to survive   & be competent.
      In order to do it, I channel my unique position of being in the middle of two industries to potentialize collaboration & understanding. From leading production teams to running my own business.
