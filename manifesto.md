I'm involved in two different but very symbiotic industries: tech & design.

As a creative, my purpose is to bring new ideas and concepts in the world.

As a technologist, my intention is to solve society's difficulties.

As an entrepreneur, my intention is to beat time & adversities.

My goal is to become someone who can bring ideas to the world that are so powerful and world-changing that they deserve their own name.

Companies need to be able to test & validate ideas as often as possible in order to survive & be competent.

In order to do it, I channel my unique position of being in the middle of two industries to nurture mutual collaboration & understanding. From leading production teams to running my own business.
