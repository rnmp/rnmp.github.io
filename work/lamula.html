  <p class="hero">La Mula, Or How I Helped To Build A  Massive Citizens-Owned News Portal</p>
  <img src="/img/work/lamula/intro.png" alt="">
  <p>From 2010 until 2012, I worked with one of Peru’s biggest news startups, La Mula (lamula.pe). This is a unique take on journalism, as any user can post news and feed the sources, yet, it is all meant to have a serious undertone. Since then, it has become an influential news portal in the country, with journalistic research as well as web video shows. In 2013, users from La Mula debunked illegal business practices from a multi-million car dealership in Lima, making the platform a source for consumer justice. La Mula currently receives more than 300,000 monthly visits.</p>

  <p>Such a successful platform is the result of years of research and collaboration that concluded in an innovative platform with focus on its end users. I am lucky to have been involved in the beginning and to be able to take some of the credit for it. I was hired to do my two main areas of expertise: I worked as a designer and product innovator, helping create what would become the main components of the interaction, driving inspiration from sites like Pinterest, Tumblr and Facebook to bring a unique posting experience.</p>
  <p>I also worked as a developer, actually building the interfaces that I designed, crafting the frontend architecture (still in use today) and the iconic horizontal slider on the homepage.</p>
  <p>The company owning La Mula, an internet company called RCP (short for Red Científica Peruana) had started the project in early 2008, one of many ventures of the company. RCP is responsible for managing the Peruvian domain name “.pe” (e.g. yourwebsite.pe) and also works as an internet development agency. Most ideas in the States need of proper investors to succeed, but in Peru, such an internet industry did not exist nor had flourished just yet.</p>
  <p>This wasn’t a problem for RCP, however, as funding was coming directly from contracts with the government and other of its clients. While money was not a limitation, La Mula still competed with other company priorities for RPC (such as Yachay or the internet domain management). This limited the designers and developers available. With the growing popularity of La Mula, all these constraints were being challenged by the main goal of preparing the platform for scale, with two related but different streams of work:</p>
  <ol>
  	<li><em>Innovation in the publishing experience.</em> Given the design and the blogging platform in which La Mula was built, there wasn’t much flexibility in how the content was presented and explored by the users. The blogging platform in which La Mula was built, WordPress Multi-User (MU), was restricted to traditional blogging taxonomy and was lacking more fluidity in the content, especially in its editorial faculties. This was my main focus during the project.</li>
  	<li><em>Visual redesign and interfaces.</em> In order to resonate with its users and therefore drive major adoption, ;
    the interface needed to be thought of holistically and approached with consistency and a modern outlook. The site had gone through a couple of redesigns in the past, but major newspapers had more professional and editorial designs that La Mula was not featuring.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Innovation in the publishing experience</h1>
	<p>The objective of “innovation” was not “change for the sake of change”. There was a clear need to amplify how journalistic type of content (interviews, columns, videos, etc.) was created and to bring this concept users who are not journalists by education. Popular newspapers in Peru, such as El Comercio or La Republica all had a staff of journalists who had a better sense of the platform there were using. To bring this to the average user, required innovation.</p>
  <p>First, we defined what type of content we wanted La Mula to have. While a lot of this was easy since the platform was more than 3 years old, this also opened opportunities to develop new formats, most of which naturally evolved from both traditional journalism to online journalism. We came up with six: News, Columns, Videos, Interviews, Broadcasts and Reviews.</p>
 <!--  <ol>
    <li><em>News.</em> Most recent news online would fit under this format. Usually with just a picture. </li>
    <li><em>Columns.</em> Much like any opinion article in politics and society, users could use this format to express their thoughts.</li>
    <li><em>Videos (reportajes).</em> The content posted under <em>reportajes</em> would normally be much like News, except it would include a video from either TV or La Mula’s own web videos. </li>
    <li><em>Interviews.</em> Content under this format would have a visual layout designed especially for questions and answers.</li>
    <li><em>Broadcasts (crónicas).</em> Sometimes, news would run for a longer period than regular events. This format was designed for that.</li>
    <li><em>Reviews.</em> This format tapped at the kind of user who may not necessarily be so fond on society and economics, but culture. Creating reviews of books, restaurants, and products allows them to tap that potential.</li>
  </ol> -->
  <p>These formats would present differences in their layouts to create a richer, more visual design, but also for better navigation and exploration of the platform, perfect for serving a larger user base in the long run. </p>
  <p>We also did additional exploration in generating trending topics and connecting articles to external newspapers, creating and environment of impartiality.</p>

  <h1>Visual design and interfaces</h1>
  <p>To put our publishing experience in practice, we experimented with different ways to bring the complexity of different formats to users. We didn’t go to far until we realize that Tumblr had created such a fun and structured way of publishing that resemble exactly the purpose of having a news portal powered by anyone interested in posting news. It became our main source of inspiration on the posting side.</p>
  <p>Presenting a large number of content posted daily by dozen of users while preserving balance and everyone’s content was exposed was a challenge. This resulted in a combination of a multi column layout that I help to also build, as well as designing an algorithm to more effectively render multiple columns. This idea would eventually become a separate open source product of mine, <a href="http://salvattore.com">Salvattore</a>.</p>
  <p>The featured content in the top homepage of the header, also required a solution that would allow for multiple posts  to be feature to give exposure to more users as well as addressing multiple interests and topics of new visitors. For this, I designed and implemented a horizontal slider designed for mobiles (as well as desktops) that is still in use today.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Working in La Mula has challenged multiple level of my design and development skills and has set the foundations for multiple new challenges in the future. It challenged me at a high level, thinking of the potential of the product and how to bring its most potential to all users. It challenged me at a low level, overseeing the implementation details and designing multiple components of interaction.</p>
  <p>I have also seen the platform grow and become more relevant day by day to reach its more than 300,000 visits per month, as well as inspiring other similar platforms like Utero.pe that also serve alternative journalism to any Peruvian.</p>
